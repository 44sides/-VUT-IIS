Information Systems - Chytni zavadu

The extension with a user-friendly interface for this information system is implemented here:

https://github.com/44sides/-VUT-ITU

The task is to create an information system for reporting problems and defects detected by city residents (e.g. non-functioning street lamp). Each issue is represented by a ticket. it is possible to attach images to the ticket, continuously add comments and change its status. The ticket is used for communication between the resident and the city administrator, who, based on the essence of the problem, can create service requests and assign them to service workers (e.g. changing a light bulb in a lamp, etc.). Based on the solution of the tasks, the city manager then updates the status of the ticket and thus informs the residents about the status of the solution. Users will also be able to use the information system as: administrator, city administrator, service worker, resident, unregistered.
